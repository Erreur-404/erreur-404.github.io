Ok so this challenge was a quick but cool one. We are given a simple ELF binary as follows.

> $ file d04497a8afdee258a04b004eb029eed8
>
> d04497a8afdee258a04b004eb029eed8: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter
 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=4d43964329bcfe200c4cd48f640fa452b0797b02, not stripp
ed 

When run, the file prints a string that looks like garbage and returns a non-null exit code, which could mean that something wrong happened.

# The Code

After running the program once, I was interested in looking at what's under the hood. To do so, I opened Ghidra and started disassembling and decompiling the program. It was pretty straightforward. As you can see by reading the following decompiled code of the main function, the program loads hexadecimal values into memory and then executes it.

``` C
undefined8 main(void) {
  undefined4 local_68;
  undefined4 local_64;
  undefined4 local_60;
  undefined4 local_5c;
  undefined4 local_58;
  undefined4 local_54;
  undefined4 local_50;
  undefined4 local_4c;
  undefined4 local_48;
  undefined4 local_44;
  undefined4 local_40;
  undefined4 local_3c;
  undefined4 local_38;
  undefined4 local_34;
  undefined4 local_30;
  undefined4 local_2c;
  undefined4 local_28;
  undefined4 local_24;
  undefined4 local_20;
  undefined4 local_1c;
  undefined4 local_18;
  undefined local_14;
  undefined4 *local_10;
  
  local_68 = 0x485e2beb;
  local_64 = 0xc180c931;
  local_60 = 0x13368022;
  local_5c = 0xe2c6ff48;
  local_58 = 0xee8348f8;
  local_54 = 0xc0314822;
  local_50 = 0x894801b0;
  local_4c = 0xfa8948c7;
  local_48 = 0x23c28348;
  local_44 = 0x3148050f;
  local_40 = 0xf3cb0c0;
  local_3c = 0xffd0e805;
  local_38 = 0x60cffff;
  local_34 = 0xf670d0b;
  local_30 = 0x30071e23;
  local_2c = 0x3a05203f;
  local_28 = 0x9133d04;
  local_24 = 0x3c382f2f;
  local_20 = 0x250c071b;
  local_1c = 0x27227a2e;
  local_18 = 0xa090210;
  local_14 = 0;
  local_10 = &local_68;
  (*(code *)local_10)();
  return 0;
}
```

These hex values correspond to the machine code, so we can easily disassemble those using [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org) with the "Disassemble x86" operation accompanied with a "Swap Endianness". Here's what we get:

# A Deeper Analysis

When you look closely at the code, you can see that it basically executes the function that starts at `0x0000000000000002`. The function first XORs a key (0x13) to 34 bytes (0x22) coming from the RSI register, then write the xored values to STDOUT using the `sys_write` syscall (0x01) and finally exits, now with the `sys_exit` syscall (0x3C), but takes the time to set the exit status to 1 instead of 0. Since there doesn't seem to be a choice between different exit values, it seems like 1 is actually the default in this case and we shouldn't waste too much time on it. 

Now that we understand the program and since we still don't have the flag, let's get back to the name of the challenge: _Wrong Byte!_. The name implies that only one byte is wrong, not more. If we summarize the program's intent once more, it essentially XORs a given large hex value with the 0x13 key. What if this key is the wrong byte? We would get a different output for sure. 

To do this, we first need to extract the hexadecimal value. Since it corresponds to the value of the RSI register and it is set using `pop RSI` as the first instruction of the function that starts at `0x0000000000000002`, then we know that it is the return address, which means the first address following `CALL 0x0000000000000002`. Also, the instructions `XOR RCX, RCX` and `add CL, 0x22` tell us that the size of the hex value is 0x22, which means 34 bytes because RCX is the counter register, holding the number of loops that will be done with the `loop` instruction. It just happens to be that there are exactly 34 bytes following `CALL 0x0000000000000002`! So we know that our large hexadecimal value is this:

> 0x0C060B0D670F231E07303F20053A043D13092F2F383C1B070C252E7A22271002090A

# To Automation

This Python script will automate the decryption with different one byte keys to find the flag

``` python
def xor_string(input_bytes, key):
  key_byte = bytes([key])
  result_bytes = bytes([b ^ key for b in input_bytes])
  result_string = result_bytes.decode('utf-8')
  return result_string

hexadecimal_value = 0xa09021027227a2e250c071b3c382f2f09133d043a05203f30071e230f670d0b060c.to_bytes(34, 'little')

for key in range(255):
    result = xor_string(hexadecimal_value, key)
    if result.startswith('FLAG-'):
      print(f"Key = {key}, flag = {result[:-1]}")
      exit()
```

And we get 

> Key = 74, flag = FLAG-EiTMzujOpNwYCeervQMFod0hmZHC

# Conclusion

This was a nice challenge, well built to prevent or limit the use of decompilers. It's also a great way to learn the language for someone new or eager to learn.
